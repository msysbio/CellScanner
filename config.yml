    If no `path` is provided, CellScanner will fail.
    Under `filenames`, provide the filenames of the blank files. 
    If no filenames are provided, CellScanner will assume that any .fcs file under the `path` is a blank.
    Example: docker run -v ~/software/CellScannerApp/Testfiles/:/media cellscanner
    You can use both relative paths and paths based on the home directory (~).

    Provide files to be used for the training of the model. 
    If your files are under different pathways, you may add as many `directory` entries as you wish.
    A directory needs to have all `path`, `filenames` and `species_names`.
    Important! Species names need to be in the same order as the filenames so CellScanner can map correctly which species is described by each file.
    You can use both relative paths and paths based on the home directory (~).

  description: >
    Provide the coculture files you wish to classify. 
    You may have as many `file_path` entries as you wish; each `file_path` stands for a certain `path` and for each, you may specify certain co-culture .fcs files of your interest.
    If a `path` has no `filenames`, all .fcs files in the `path` will be used.
    You can use both relative paths and paths based on the home directory (~).

    (optional)
    In case you want to use a previously trained model, you may provide the path to its files.
    Make sure that the path provided includes all the following 3 files: 
    - trained_model.keras
    - scaler.pkl
    - label_encoder.pkl
    If any of these files is missinge, CellScanner will fail.
    Attention! When a previous model is used, you need to make sure you provide the scaling_constant you used to train the model.

    Early stopping is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting when training 
    a model with an iterative method. In CellScanner's implementation, we monitor the value of the 
    accuracy. Patience stands for the mumber of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.

filter_out_uncertain:
  value: false
  threshold: 0.5
  required: false
  default: false
  description: >
    Set true in case you wish to filter out uncertain predictions. 
    In case you wish to filter out uncertain predictions, an uncertainty threshold is required.
    Uncertainties are predicted using Shannon entropy and thus, the maximum entropy is log(number_of_classes).
    Therefore, threshold may range from 0 to log(number_of_classes) and the lower the threshold, the stricter the filtering, 
    the more uncertain predictions will be filtered out (assigned as Unknown).
    You may set this value with one of the following ways:
    - set any value between 0 and log(number_of_classes)
    - set it to -1 and CellScanner will compute the generally used 0.5 threshold of the maximum entropy, and will use this as the threshold
    - set its value as `true` and leave the `threshold` parameter empty. In this case, CellScanner will automatically set the threshold 
    to the one that returns the maximum accuracy on your training set.

  description: >

  type: bool

#   -------------------------      For all stains     -------------------------
#
# To enable gating, you need to provide at least one `Stain` which requires three parameters:
# - channel (str): takes values the exact name of a column in the coculture file.
# - sign (str): can be either `greater_than` or `less_than`, mentioning whether the channel needs to have a value
#          higher or lower from the one you are about to set as threshold.
# - value (int): the threshold of the stain.
#
# IMPORTANT: Some visualization software may transform raw data.  !!
# Ensure you set the threshold based on the raw data, not post-transformation.
#
# Gating can be applied in both training model step, to "filter" the entries used from the blanks and the monoculture s
# but also in the prediction step.
# CellScanner allows you to have different values for the two steps, but using different values is considered an advance use for experts.
#
# Last, for the prediction step, you may also apply as many line gating filters as you wish by simply adding stains in the extra_stains
